# Linear Regression (Continued)  Multiple Regression (An Introduction)

# Preliminaries
# True (Population Equation)
# y = B + B1x  (Deterministic Model: each value of x corresponds to a
# unique value of y)  For an arbitrary data set this is rare and 
# unusual

# E(y) = B + B1x (Probabilistic Model: each value of x does not
# necessarily correspond to a unique value of y. that is, the y's can
# vary for a given value of x.  E(y) is called the expected value of 
# the different y values for a fixed x value. E(y) is also said to be
# the mean of the different y values for a fixed x value)

# E(y) is formally called the linear regression function


#Example 1  (A perfect Fit!!)

S<-c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50)
S  # (Dependent or Response)
U<-c(60,57,54,51,48,45,42,39,36,33)
U  #(Independent or Explanatory)

# Let's examine the scatter plot

plot(S~U)

# Lets find the correlation coefficient  (r or R)
cor(S,U)  

# Wow !!  Perfect correlation !!

# Now let's produce a linear model

lm(S~U)->k
k

summary(k)

# The linear regression model is:  S =  1.05000 - 1.667U

# Let's  graph the regression line through the data points
scatter.smooth(S~U)

# Let's examine the output.

# Why is the Residual standard error nearly 0 ?

# What is the typical distance between a sampled slope estimate
# and the true slope from the population ?

# Interpret the Multiple R-squared value.

# Should the null hypothesis that the Population slope equals 
# zero be rejected ?

# Is the relationship between the response variable and the 
# explanatory variable of the population dependent or independent ?

# Example 2  Textbook Problem

# The prediction equation relating the  x = years of education and 
# y = annual income in dollars is  y(hat) = -20,000 +  4000x, 
# and the correlation = .50.  The standard deviations were 2.0 for
# x and 16,000 for y.

#   a) Interpret the slope

#   b) For a correlation of .50, do you expect a strong or weak 
# linear pattern shown by the scatter plot?

#   c) Find the proportion of the variability in y that is explained
# by the linear regression model. What proportion of the variability
# is due to other factors or chance?

#   d) Show how to find the correlation from the slope.

#       r = b(s(x)/s(y))
